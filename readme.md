# FirmaChain

### A BLOCKCHAIN BASED E-CONTRACT PLATFORM

FirmaChain adds a signing and verifying e-contract function to the blockchain. 

Unlocking new limits of electronic contracts with blockchain technology, FirmaChain seeks to resolve all the social and legal issues (contracts, notarial, etc.) with written contracts through the use of electronic contracts based on FirmaChainâ€™s data blockchain.

FirmaChain now builds on [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus and the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) toolkits and [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport)
