# Governance Proposal Directory

Welcome to the **Governance Proposal Directory** for the FirmaChain ecosystem. This directory contains all governance proposals submitted to the FirmaChain network, along with templates and guidelines for creating and submitting new proposals. The goal of this directory is to ensure transparency, accountability, and effective decision-making within the FirmaChain ecosystem.

## **Purpose of Governance Proposals**
Governance proposals are the primary mechanism for proposing changes, improvements, or new initiatives within the FirmaChain ecosystem. Proposals can cover a wide range of topics, including:
- Technical upgrades and protocol changes.
- Funding requests for development, marketing, or community initiatives.
- Policy changes or governance framework updates.
- Strategic initiatives to grow and improve the network.

## **Governance Proposal Process**
It is highly recommended to submit the FirmaChain Request for Comment (FRC) before submitting a governance proposal to receive community feedback. The governance process in FirmaChain follows these steps:

### **1. Submit a Firmachain Request for Comment (FRC)**
- Use the [FRC Template](../FRC/FRC-template.md) to draft your proposal.
- Share the FRC with the community for initial feedback and discussion.

### **2. Discussion on FRC**
- Engage with the community to gather feedback, address concerns, and refine your proposal.
- Discussions can take place on the Github Issues section, FirmaChain Discord Forum, or other community channels.

### **3. Submission to FirmaChain Repository**
- Once the FRC has been discussed and refined, gather FRCs and submit the final proposal to the FirmaChain Repository.
- Refer to the **How to Submit a Governance Proposal** section below.

### **4. Submission to FirmaChain Mainnet**
- Once the Proposal has been discussed and merged, submit the final proposal to the FirmaChain Mainnet using Explorer Governance Section.
- Ensure all required details (e.g., motivation, specification, budget) are included.

### **5. Voting Period**
- The proposal enters a voting period, during which stakeholders can cast their votes.
- Voting options typically include:
  - **Yes**: Approve the proposal.
  - **No**: Reject the proposal.
  - **Abstain**: Neutral or no opinion.

### **6. Implementation**
- If the proposal passes the **quorum** and achieves a **positive voting majority**, it will be implemented.
- The implementation plan should be followed as outlined in the proposal.
