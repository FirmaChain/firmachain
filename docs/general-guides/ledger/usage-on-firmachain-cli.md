## Create an address with the Ledger

Please unlock your Ledger Nano S/X by entering the pin code. Additionally, if either your Ledger Live application is running or if you have a running application that connects your Ledger Nano S/X (e.g. Ledger Live), please close all such applications.&#x20;

_\* Ledger Nano S/X only supports 1:1 connection._

### Preparations

This stage outlines the necessary steps you must take to create a Ledger Nano S/X wallet.

initialize chain

```
firmachaind init test-node-001 --chain-id roma-1
```

change gas prices

```
vim ~/.firmachain/config/app.toml
# minimum-gas-prices = "0.01ufct"
```

### Create FirmaChain Wallet using the Ledger Tag

By running the command provided below, you can create the key information connected with your Ledger Nano S/X on local.

```
firmachaind keys add <key_name> --coin-type 7777777 --ledger
```

If you are using mnemonic, please run the command provided below.

```
firmachaind keys add <key_name> --recover --coin-type 7777777 --ledger
```

Once you complete the steps above, an address will appear on the screen of your connected Ledger Nano S/X. By clicking on the button on the right, you can check your wallet information. Finally, approve by simultaneously clicking on the two buttons located on the top of your Ledger.
