# Join the Colosseum (mainnet)

## Before Getting Started

Before getting started with the developer documentation, we offer our deepest gratitude to all those who have supported FirmaChain’s journey to launching our **Colosseum** mainnet and especially to our testnet validators. Thanks to our validator’s valued contributions, we were able to solve a lot of issues during the testnet phase, and ultimately we were able to successfully launch our **Colosseum** mainnet.

## Instruction

The validator guide details the necessary steps a participant must take in order to become our **Colosseum** mainnet validator. This guide is written for two different types of audiences, one of which would be those participating as Genesis Validators with the launch of our mainnet and the other being those participating as validators after the launch of our mainnet. Please refer to the guide that suits your participation status.
